					<h2 align="center">About Me</h2>
					<p>I am a highly motivated and results-driven senior software engineer with a proven track record of innovative contributions across diverse projects.
I graduated from Purdue University in 2020 with a Degree in Computer Engineering & a Certificate of Entrepreneurship and Innovation.

<br> My industry experience began at Qualcomm through a Software Engineering Internship in the LTE Modem chipset SW Department. During my internship, I worked on creating tools and automating processes to save engineers time debugging and completing daily tasks using C and Python.

<br> Upon graduation, I returned to Qualcomm as a full-time Software Engineer in the same department. Over the next 3 years, I worked with Project managers to successfully lead the complete Software Development Life Cycle for various cutting-edge software features. (Planning, analyzing, designing, implementing, testing, deploying, and maintaining the code) Doing so helped fortify SWE & CS skills as well as enabled me to become well-versed and thrive in fast-paced and dynamic environments.

<br> During my tenure at Qualcomm, I demonstrated a knack for optimizing and reducing memory footprints, implementing advanced algorithms and maintaining a resilient codebase. I collaborated on projects that required intricate problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of software details. My work contributed to substantial improvements in LTE modem chip performance and overall system stability and robustness which leads to a much better user experience.

<br> My background also extends beyond industry experience to research projects I did during college such as Indoor Positioning System and Data Analytics for Smart Cities, demonstrating my ability to create impactful technologies that help the society using Machine Learning algorithms and frameworks, such as TensorFlow.

<br> I also hold Machine Learning certifications from Stanford and Intro to AWS technologies, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning.


<br> My value for code scalability/performance, my adaptive mindset, my collaborative spirit, my ability to manage projects end-to-end, as well as my proficiency gained through research and certifications make me a valuable asset to your company's innovation-driven culture.
</p>
					<h2 align="center">My Interests</h2>
					<p>My interests lie within the spectrum of software/coding. I am really interested in the field of Machine Learning and automation control. I would love to combine the passion that I have for Machine Learning and the skills that I acquire to have a postive impact on society.
					I also love interacting with people. Therefore, my ideal goal would be combining my passion for software and my communication skills to help benefit people. Hence, positions like UX design and Program Manager are my ultimate goals. </p>
